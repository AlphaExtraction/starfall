      The <b class="spectext haze">Haze</b> is a realm that contains the
      concepts and ideas of certain realities as energy. With the human world
      <i class="spectext magna">(Magnatic Realm)</i>, the mind and identities of
      people are recorded, being preserved even after death. However, these
      records will quickly fade away if not they are not retained by special
      intervention.
    </p>
    <!--Human knowledge of the <b>Haze</b> comes from firsthand accounts,
      with each account varying drastically. However, common sights include
      dense fog, familiar locations, and silhouetted figures. Some of the
      figures stand and walk around normally, but most of them were seen
      floating in the air and walking through walls.-->
    <p class="par p1">
      For each person, the appearance of the <b>Haze</b> changes, with the most
      common being around last location they remembered being in before death.
      The realm appears identical to the original location, down to the
      surrounding life and machinery, only frozen in time. And as given by its
      name, the area is also covered in a dense fog, with light coming from just
      beyond the fog.
    </p>
    <p class="par p1">
      After one's death, the last record of that person gains sentience and is
      able to fully perceive the <b>Haze</b>, but after a few minutes, ceases to
      exist. Others in the realm perceive this phenomenon as them suddenly
      freezing, then making impossible movements like floating above the ground
      or phasing through solid matter before disappearing out of view.
    </p>
    <p class="par p2">
      Due to the nature of this realm, it does not occupy any physical space.
      All descriptions of the <b>Haze</b> in reality are from mental images
      given by the living with connections to the realm. Even though they remain
      alive, looking into the <b>Haze</b> changes them irreversibly. There are
      three types of these people: the <b class="spectext face">Faceless</b>,
      the <b class="spectext heart">Heartless</b>, and the
      <b class="spectext soul">Soulless</b>.
