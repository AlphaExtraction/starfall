      A realm that contains the concepts and ideas of certain realities as
      energy. With the human world
      <i class="spectext magna">(Magnatic Realm)</i>, the thoughts and
      identities of people are recorded, being preserved even after death.
      However, these records will quickly fade away if not they are not retained
      by special intervention.
    </p>
    <p class="par p1">
      The <b class="spectext haze">Haze</b> also acts as a gateway between
      realities, but only in certain situations. One of these is a reality
      suffering a catastrophic failure, if the laws of the reality are somehow
      violated. The <b class="spectext haze">Haze</b> descends upon it and
      relocates the violator(s) to another reality, one capable of hosting them.
      During relocation, lingering concepts or thoughts may latch onto the
      violators and alter them as they enter the new reality.
    </p>
    <p class="par p2">
      Simply being within the <b class="spectext haze">Haze</b> is dangerous, as
      both the metaphysical and physical body will erode. There are also
      specific conditions that allow one to resist this process, such as special
      intervention which was mentioned earlier. The intervention can be caused
      either by special procedures performed in oneâ€™s original world, or by
      being intercepted by other survivors in the
      <b class="spectext haze">Haze</b> before complete dissolution, in which
      one can be reconstructed.
    </p>
    <p class="par p1">
      Living humans of the <i class="spectext magna">Magnatic Realm</i> who are
      able to perceive the <b class="spectext haze">Haze</b> are known as the
      <b class="spectext face">Faceless</b>. They are identical to regular
      humans, but once dead, memories of them among normal people begin to
      disappear. On the other hand, their last recorded consciousness in the
      <b class="spectext haze">Haze</b> has a longer lifespan and a much higher
      chance of resisting erasure. Becoming
      <b class="spectext face">Faceless</b> results from long-term exposure to
      phenomena originating from different realities, as these phenomena contain
      energy from the <b class="spectext haze">Haze</b> during relocation.
    </p>
    <p class="par p1">
      Humans that not only perceive the <b class="spectext haze">Haze</b>, but
      are also able to directly interact with it are known as the
      <b class="spectext heart">Heartless</b>. Upon becoming one, they undergo a
      radical personality change. This shift is severe enough that people who
      knew them previously perceive them as an entirely different individual,
      and are completely unable to recognize them as who they were before. The
      only ones who can are the other <b class="spectext heart">Heartless</b>.
      To become one, you need to be dying while directly perceiving both your
      reality and the <b class="spectext haze">Haze</b> simultaneously. The
      chance of succeeding over death is extremely slim.

    <p class="par p1">
      Beings from the <i class="spectext aster">Asteric Realm</i> who were
      relocated to the <i class="spectext magna">Magnatic Realm</i> are known as
      the <b class="spectext soul">Soulless</b>. In their original reality, they
      were unable to interact with the <b class="spectext haze">Haze</b>, and
      only after relocation did they gain sapience and perception of that realm.
      In addition, each one gained a different gift in accordance to their new
      bodies, elevating their abilities far beyond the human limit. In exchange
      however, their bodies have an abysmally short lifespan and they lose all
      access to the <b class="spectext haze">Haze</b> upon death. To avoid
      death, they must either all return to their original reality or find a way
      to exist within the <i class="spectext magna">Magnatic Realm's</i> rules.
      Most of the <b class="spectext soul">Soulless</b> opted to go back, but
